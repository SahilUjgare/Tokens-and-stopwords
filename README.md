# NLP Tokens & Stopwords 

This project demonstrates basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) steps such as **tokenization** and **stopword removal** using Python. It provides a simple workflow to preprocess text data for further NLP or machine-learning tasks.

## 📌 Features

* Tokenization using NLTK
* Stopword removal
* Cleaning and preprocessing of raw text
* Easy-to-follow example code in Jupyter Notebook

## 🗂 File Included

* **NLP_Tokens&Stopwords.ipynb** – The main notebook containing code, explanations, and output.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install nltk
   ```
2. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook NLP_Tokens&Stopwords.ipynb
   ```
3. Run cells in order to see tokenization and stopword filtering in action.

## 📘 Requirements

* Python 3.x
* NLTK
* Jupyter Notebook

## 📄 Description

The notebook walks through:

* Loading text data
* Tokenizing text into words
* Removing common stopwords
* Displaying cleaned tokens
